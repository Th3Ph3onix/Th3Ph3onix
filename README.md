- 👋 Hi, I’m @Th3Ph3onix
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to build websites, and am very intereseted in becoming a developer.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, and anything to do with code that I can get my hands on.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on pretty much anything. I know a lot about tech, I just haven't learned to code. I love designing websites and making them grab the users attention.
- 📫 You can reach me at pheonixdevon@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: I'm a female.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I like taking programs apart, not to copy them or do anything black-hat, I just like trying to figure out how it works. And since I can't code, it's pretty much a worthless hobby. (Yes, only open source.😉)
